4;Robert Trevino conducts Mahler;The Symphony No. 7 by Gustav Mahler was written in 1904-05, with repeated revisions to the scoring. It is sometimes referred to by the title Song of the Night (German: Lied der Nacht), which Mahler never knew.\nThe Symphony no. 7 is among the most difficult and complex of Mahler's nine symphonies, according to the composer himself, who worked on it in a fit of rage in almost total isolation. The Symphony was less successful with the public, compared to the remarkable interest in the music scene.\nRobert Trevino (born 1984) is an American conductor. He is currently music director of the Basque National Orchestra in Spain, principal guest conductor of the Orchestra Sinfonica Nazionale della RAI, and artistic advisor of the Malmo Symphony Orchestra in Sweden.;27/05/2023;23;24
5;Galleria Giorgio Franchetti: From Donatello to Alessandra Vittoria;The Galleria Giorgio Franchetti alla Ca' d'Oro hosts From Donatello to Alessandro Vittoria, 1450 - 1600. 150 Years of Sculpture in the Republic of Venice, the first major Venetian exhibition dedicated to Venetian sculpture curated by Toto Bergamo Rossi, director of Venetian Heritage and Claudia Cremonini, director of Galleria Giorgio Franchetti alla Ca' d'Oro. Organized and financed by the Venetian Heritage Foundation, in collaboration with the Veneto Regional Directorate for Museums, the exhibition will take place from April 22 to October 30, 2022. The Galleria Giorgio Franchetti alla Ca' d'Oro, with one of the most important collections in the city in terms of the quality of its works from different periods and types, has always been one of the cornerstones of the merging of private and public collections in Venice, and the place of excellence for the concentration of sculptural masterpieces from dispersed monumental contexts, largely conceived for dismembered or no longer existing ecclesiastical complexes in the lagoon area.\nThe show, installed at the museum's piano nobile, will focus on the dialogue between several works of masters operating in Venice and in the territories of the Republic between the 15th  and 17th centuries, such as Donatello, Antonio Rizzo, Pietro, Tullio and Antonio Lombardo and also Jacopo Sansovino and Alessandro Vittoria, displaying, in addition to pieces already known to the general public, some sculptures never seen in museum contexts. The exhibition aims to give back to the visitors the interpretative variety of the sculptura-l technique, underlining its value and the richness of aesthetic declinations and materials within a historical-artistic context that too often prefers painting in the artistic discourse on Venice.;22/04/2023;12;25
6;The Burano Carnival;"The Venice Carnival is the most internationally known festival celebrated in Venice, and is also one of the oldest.\nThe origin of this celebraton of fashination, elegance, colours, madness and mistery goes back to the year 1296, when the Serenissima Republic declared the Shrove Tuesday (mardi gras) a city holiday. At that time, the celebrations lasted for six weeks, from the Boxing Day to Mardi Gras, when the end of the Carnival announced the beginning of the Lent. The celebrations reached their peak on Carnival Thursday and ended the day before Ash Wednesday, even if the permission of wearing masks and disguises was often given from the beginning of October and it was not unusual to attend parties and banquets during Lent.\nThe celebrations for the Carnival were abolished after nearly 500 years by Napoleon in 1797 and were reinstated only when the city was submitted to Austria.During the years 1970s-1980s the Carnival celebrations experienced a period of decline: in Venice no more parties were organized, and the almost 900 years tradition was left at the mercy of disappearance.It was only thanks to Burano that the festival survived. For this reason soon the Burano Carnival (""El Carneval de Buran"") became an unmissable event for Buranelli, Venetians, people coming from all over the Veneto and of course tourists.\nNowadays Burano still represents a focal point of the annual official program made by the Venice Carnival Organization.";22/02/2023;0;26

9;Biennale Art 2022: The Milk Of Dreams;The Milk of Dreams takes its title from a book by Leonora Carrington (1917�2011) in which the Surrealist artist describes a magical world where life is constantly re-envisioned through the prism of the imagination. It is a world where everyone can change, be transformed, become something or someone else, a world set free, brimming with possibilities. But it is also the allegory of a century that imposed intolerable pressure on the very definition of the self, forcing Carrington into a life of exile: locked up in mental hospitals, an eternal object of fascination and desire, yet also a figure of startling power and mystery, always fleeing the strictures of a fixed, coherent identity. When asked about her birth, Carrington would say she was the product of her mother�s encounter with a machine, suggesting the same bizarre union of human, animal, and mechanical that marks much of her work.\nThe exhibition The Milk of Dreams takes Leonora Carrington�s otherworldly creatures, along with other figures of transformation, as companions on an imaginary journey through the metamorphoses of bodies and definitions of the human.\nThis exhibition is grounded in many conversations with artists held in the last few years. The questions that kept emerging from these dialogues seem to capture this moment in history when the very survival of the species is threatened, but also to sum up many other inquiries that pervade the sciences, arts, and myths of our time. How is the definition of the human changing? What constitutes life, and what differentiates plant and animal, human and non-human? What are our responsibilities towards the planet, other people, and other life forms? And what would life look like without us?\nThese are some of the guiding questions for this edition of the Biennale Arte, which focuses on three thematic areas in particular: the representation of bodies and their metamorphoses, the relationship between individuals and technologies, the connection between bodies and the Earth.\nAs visitors move through the exhibition in the Central Pavilion and the Corderie, they encounter five smaller, historical sections: miniature constellations of artworks, found objects, and documents, clustered together to explore certain key themes. Conceived like time capsules, these shows within the show provide additional tools of investigation and introspection, weaving a web of references and echoes that link artworks of the past � including major museum loans and unconventional selections � to the pieces by contemporary artists in the surrounding space.\nThis wide-ranging, transhistorical approach traces kinships and affinities between artistic methods and practices, even across generations, to create new layers of meaning and bridge present and past. What emerges is a historical narrative that is not built around systems of direct inheritance or conflict, but around forms of symbiosis, solidarity, and sisterhood.;23/04/2023;25.5;29
10;"Lido Incontra"" France, Francophone Culture and Venice""";"The Proloco of Lido and Pellestrina presents the third edition of ""Lido Incontra,"" which aims to delve into the intersections of history and culture between the city of Venice and those peoples who to varying degrees and in different ways have come into contact with La Serenissima. After the forced hiatus due to the pandemic, Proloco Lido e Pellestrina proposes, for this third edition, a series of events focused on France, Francophone culture and Venice. The program is divided into different thematic areas (lecture, literature, history, music, theater, cinema, food and wine, festivals) that will allow different aspects of French culture to be explored from time to time. The review, which has the patronage of the City of Venice, was born from the collaboration with Alliance Fran�aise, Institut Fran�ais, Ca Foscari University and the excellences of our territory.\n";02/04/2023;0;30
