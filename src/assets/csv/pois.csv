1;Basilica di San Marco;The Patriarchal Cathedral Basilica of Saint Mark, commonly known as St Mark's Basilica, is the cathedral church of the Roman Catholic Patriarchate of Venice.\nIt is dedicated to and holds the relics of Saint Mark the Evangelist, the patron saint of the city.\n\nMiddle-Byzantine, Romanesque, and Islamic influences are evident, and Gothic elements were later incorporated. To convey the republic's wealth and power, the original brick façades and interior walls were embellished over time with precious stones and rare marbles, primarily in the thirteenth century. Many of the columns, reliefs, and sculptures were spoils stripped from the churches, palaces, and public monuments of Constantinople as a result of the Venetian participation in the Fourth Crusade.\n\nThe interior of the domes, the vaults, and the upper walls were slowly covered with gold-ground mosaics depicting saints, prophets, and biblical scenes. Many of these mosaics were later retouched or remade as artistic tastes changed and damaged mosaics had to be replaced, such that the mosaics represent eight hundred years of artistic styles.;09:30:00;17:00:00;3.5;P.za San Marco, 328, 30100 Venezia VE;1
2;Piazza San Marco;Piazza San Marco often known in English as St Mark's Square, is the principal public square of Venice, Italy, where it is generally known just as la Piazza ("the Square").\n\nAll other urban spaces in the city (except the Piazzetta and the Piazzale Roma) are called campi ("fields"). The Piazzetta ("little Piazza/Square") is an extension of the Piazza towards San Marco basin in its south east corner. The two spaces together form the social, religious and political centre of Venice and are commonly considered together;00:00:00;00:00:00;0;P.za San Marco, Venezia;2
3;Palazzo Ducale;The Doge's Palace (Italian: Palazzo Ducale, Venetian: Palaso Dogal) is a palace built in Venetian Gothic style, and one of the main landmarks of the city of Venice in northern Italy. The palace was the residence of the Doge of Venice, the supreme authority of the former Republic. It was built in 1340 and extended and modified in the following centuries. It became a museum in 1923 and is one of the 11 museums run by the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia.\n\nThe palace was built out of fortresses, one façade to the Piazzetta, the other overlooking the St. Mark's Basin. Although only few traces remain of that palace, some Byzantine-Venetian architecture characteristics can still be seen at the ground floor, with the wall base in Istrian stone and some herring-bone pattern brick paving.\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, the structure was showing clear signs of decay, and the Italian government set aside significant funds for its restoration and all public offices were moved elsewhere, with the exception of the State Office for the protection of historical Monuments, which is still housed at the palace's loggia floor.;09:00:00;19:00:00;25;Doge's palace, 30124 Venezia VE;3
4;Canal Grande;The Grand Canal (Italian: Canal Grande, Venetian: Canal Grando) is a channel in Venice, Italy. It forms one of the major water-traffic corridors in the city.\n\nOne end of the canal leads into the lagoon near the Santa Lucia railway station and the other end leads into the basin at San Marco, in between, it makes a large reverse-S shape through the central districts (sestieri) of Venice.It is 3.8 km (2.4 mi) long, and 30 to 90 m (98 to 295 ft) wide, with an average depth of 5 metres (16 feet).\n\nThe banks of the Grand Canal are lined with more than 170 buildings, most of which date from the 13th to the 18th century, and demonstrate the welfare and art created by the Republic of Venice. The noble Venetian families faced huge expenses to show off their richness in suitable palazzos, this contest reveals the citizens pride and the deep bond with the lagoon.;00:00:00;00:00:00;0;NULL;4
5;Ponte di Rialto;The Rialto Bridge (Italian: Ponte di Rialto, Venetian: Ponte de Rialto) is the oldest of the four bridges spanning the Grand Canal in Venice, Italy. Connecting the sestieri (districts) of San Marco and San Polo, it has been rebuilt several times since its first construction as a pontoon bridge in 1173, and is now a significant tourist attraction in the city.\n\nThe development and importance of the Rialto market on the eastern bank increased traffic on the floating bridge.\n\nThe present stone bridge, a single span designed by Antonio da Ponte, began to be constructed in 1588 and was completed in 1591. It is similar to the wooden bridge it succeeded. Two ramps lead up to a central portico. On either side of the portico, the covered ramps carry rows of shops. The engineering of the bridge was considered so audacious that architect Vincenzo Scamozzi predicted future ruin. The bridge has defied its critics to become one of the architectural icons, and top tourist attractions, in Venice.;00:00:00;00:00:00;0;Ponte di Rialto, Venezia VE;5
6;Torre dell'Orologio;The Clock Tower in Venice is an early Renaissance building on the north side of the Piazza San Marco, at the entrance to the Merceria.\n\nIt comprises a tower, which contains the clock, and lower buildings on each side. It adjoins the eastern end of the Procuratie Vecchie. Both the tower and the clock date from the last decade of the 15th century, though the mechanism of the clock has subsequently been much altered. It was placed where the clock would be visible from the waters of the lagoon and give notice to everyone of the wealth and glory of Venice.\n\nOn a terrace at the top of the tower are two great bronze figures, hinged at the waist, which strike the hours on a bell. One is old and the other young, to show the passing of time and, although said to represent shepherds (they are wearing sheepskins) or giants (they are huge figures of great mass, necessary so that their form can be recognized at a distance) they are known as "the Moors" because of the dark patina acquired by the bronze. The bell is also original and is signed by Simeone Campanato, who cast it at the Arsenal in 1497.;11:00:00;14:00:00;12;NULL;6
7;Teatro la Fenice;Teatro La Fenice ("The Phoenix") is an opera house in Venice, Italy. It is one of the most famous and renowned landmarks in the history of Italian theatre and in the history of opera as a whole.\n\nIts name reflects its role in permitting an opera company to "rise from the ashes" despite losing the use of three theatres to fire, the first in 1774 after the city's leading house was destroyed and rebuilt but not opened until 1792, the second fire came in 1836, but rebuilding was completed within a year. However, the third fire was the result of arson. It destroyed the house in 1996 leaving only the exterior walls, but it was rebuilt and re-opened in November 2004. In order to celebrate this event the tradition of the Venice New Year's Concert started.\n\nLa Fenice immediately made its mark as one of the leading opera houses, noted in Italy and Europe both for the high artistic quality of its work and the splendour of its building. But, almost as if the name were the bearer of bad omens, on the night of 13 December 1836 the opera house was devastated by a first fire caused by a recently installed Austrian heater. By the evening of 26 December of the same year, the new opera house, reborn in the new artistic style of the age, was opened to the public.;09:30:00;23:00:00;0;Campo S. Fantin, 1965, 30124 Venezia VE;7
8;Ca' d'Oro;The Ca' d'Oro or Palazzo Santa Sofia is a palace on the Grand Canal in Venice, northern Italy. One of the older palaces in the city, its name means "golden house" due to the gilt and polychrome external decorations which once adorned its walls. Since 1927, it has been used as a museum, as the Galleria Giorgio Franchetti.\n\nIt has long been regarded as the best surviving palazzo in Venetian Gothic architecture, retaining all the most characteristic features, despite some losses. On the facade, the loggia-like window group of closely spaced small columns, with heavy tracery with quatrefoil openings above, uses the formula from the Doge's Palace that had become iconic. There are also the byzantine-inspired decoration along the roofline, and patterning in fancy coloured stone to the flat wall surfaces. The smaller windows show a variety of forms with an ogee arch, capped with a relief ornament, and the edges and zone boundaries are marked with ropework reliefs.;08:15:00;18:00:00;11;Calle Ca' d'Oro, 3934, 30121 Venezia VE;8
9;Murano e Burano;The island was probably settled by the Romans, and in the 6th century was occupied by people from Altino, who named it for one of the gates of their former city. Two stories are attributed to how the city obtained its name. One is that it was initially founded by the Buriana family, and another is that the first settlers of Burano came from the small island of Buranello, about 8 kilometres (5 miles) to the south.\n\nIn 1291, all the glassmakers in Venice were required to move to Murano. In the following century, exports began, and the island became famous, initially for glass beads and mirrors. Aventurine glass was invented on the island, and for a while Murano was the main producer of glass in Europe. The island later became known for chandeliers. Although decline set in during the eighteenth century, glassmaking is still the island's main industry.\nIn the fifteenth century, the island became popular as a resort for Venetians, and palaces were built, but this later declined. The countryside of the island was known for its orchards and vegetable gardens until the nineteenth century, when more housing was built.;00:00:00;00:00:00;0;Murano, Venezia;9
10;Peggy Guggenheim Collection;The Peggy Guggenheim Collection is a modern art museum on the Grand Canal in the Dorsoduro sestiere of Venice, Italy. It is one of the most visited attractions in Venice. The collection is housed in the Palazzo Venier dei Leoni, an 18th-century palace, which was the home of the American heiress Peggy Guggenheim for three decades. She began displaying her private collection of modern artworks to the public seasonally in 1951.\n\nThe collection includes works of prominent Italian futurists and American modernists working in such genres as Cubism, Surrealism and abstract expressionism. It also includes sculptural works. In 2017, Karole Vail, a granddaughter of Peggy Guggenheim, was appointed Director of the collection, succeeding Philip Rylands, who led the museum for 37 years.\n\nThe museum houses an impressive selection of modern art. Its picturesque setting and well-respected collection attract some 400,000 visitors per year, making it the most-visited site in Venice after the Doge's Palace. Works on display include those of prominent Italian futurists and American modernists. Pieces in the collection embrace Cubism, Surrealism and abstract expressionism.;10:00:00;18:00:00;14;Dorsoduro, 701-704, 30123 Venezia VE;10
11;Gallerie dell'Accademia;The Gallerie dell'Accademia is a museum gallery of pre-19th-century art in Venice, northern Italy. It is housed in the Scuola della Carità on the south bank of the Grand Canal, within the sestiere of Dorsoduro. It was originally the gallery of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia, the art academy of Venice, from which it became independent in 1879, and for which the Ponte dell'Accademia and the Accademia boat landing station for the vaporetto water bus are named.\n\nThe Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia was founded on 24 September 1750, the statute dates from 1756. The first director was Giovanni Battista Piazzetta, Gianbattista Tiepolo became the first president after his return from Würzburg.\n\nThe collections of the Accademia were first opened to the public on 10 August 1817.\nThe Gallerie dell'Accademia became independent from the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia in 1879. Like other state museums in Italy, it falls under the Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali, the Italian ministry of culture and heritage.;08:15:00;19:15:00;12;Campo della Carità, 1050, 30123 Venezia VE;11
12;Santa Maria dei Miracoli;Also known as the "marble church", it is one of the best examples of the early Venetian Renaissance including colored marble, a false colonnade on the exterior walls (pilasters), and a semicircular pediment.\n\nBuilt between 1481 and 1489 by Pietro Lombardo to house a miraculous icon of the Virgin Mary. The plans for the church were expanded in 1484 to include the construction of a new convent for nuns of St. Clare to the east. The convent was connected to the gallery of the church by an enclosed walkway that was later destroyed.\n\nThe interior is enclosed by a wide barrel vault, with a single nave.The nave is dominated by an ornamental marble stair rising between two pulpits, with statues by Tullio Lombardo, Alessandro Vittoria and Niccolò di Pietro. The vaulted ceiling is divided into fifty coffers decorated with paintings of prophets, a work by Girolamo Pennacchi's contemporaries, Vincenzo dalle Destre and Lattanzio da Rimini.;10:30:00;17:00:00;3;Campiello dei Miracoli, 30121 Venezia VE;12
13;Ca' Rezzonico;Ca' Rezzonico is a palazzo on the Grand Canal in the Dorsoduro sestiere of Venice, Italy. It is a particularly notable example of the 18th century Venetian baroque and rococo architecture and interior decoration, and displays paintings by the leading Venetian painters of the period, including Francesco Guardi and Giambattista Tiepolo. \nCa' Rezzonico stands on the right bank of the canal, at the point where it is joined by the Rio di San Barnaba.\n\nThe facade was finished between 1750 and 1752. Turning his attention to the interior, Massari broke with Venetian custom and put the major ceremonial room at the back of the building, not overlooking the canal. He doubled the height of the ceiling in this room and eliminated walls to create a more dramatic space.\n\nThe palace was the site of further celebrations in 1759, when Aurelio Rezzonico was elected Procurator of San Marco, and in 1762, when Ludovico Rezzonico was elected to the same position. For three nights, the facades and interiors of the palace were lit with torches and candles in celebration.;10:00:00;18:00:00;10;Dorsoduro, 3136, 30123 Venezia VE;13
14;Isola di Torcello;Torcello is a sparsely populated island at the northern end of the Venetian Lagoon, in north-eastern Italy. It was first settled in the year 452 and has been referred to as the parent island from which Venice was populated. It was a town with a cathedral and bishops before St Mark's Basilica was built.\n\nTorcello benefited from and maintained close cultural and trading ties with Constantinople: however, being a rather distant outpost of the Eastern Roman Empire, it could establish de facto autonomy from the eastern capital.\n\nTorcello rapidly grew in importance as a political and trading centre: in the 10th century it had a population often estimated at 10,000-35,000 people, with 20,000 the most commonly cited estimate. However, some recent estimates by archeologists place it at closer to a maximum of 3,000. In pre-Medieval times, Torcello was a much more powerful trading center than Venice.;00:00:00;00:00:00;0;Torcello, Venezia;14
15;Lido di Venezia;The Lido, or Venice Lido (Italian: Lido di Venezia), is an 11-kilometre-long (7-mile) barrier island in the Venetian Lagoon, northern Italy, it is home to about 20,400 residents. The Venice Film Festival takes place at the Lido late August/early September.\n\nThe Lido island is one of the two barrier islands of the Lagoon of Venice, the other is Pellestrina. They form the central part of the coastline of the lagoon on the Adriatic Sea.\n\nLido is a long and narrow island which gets wider in its northern tract. At least half the seaward coast has sandy beaches. Much of the beach at the town of Lido belongs to various hotels. There are large public beaches towards the northern and southern ends.;00:00:00;00:00:00;0;NULL;15

17;La Biennale;The Venice Biennale is an international cultural exhibition hosted annually in Venice, Italy by the Biennale Foundation. The biennale has been organised every year since 1895, which makes it the oldest of its kind.\n\nThe Art Biennale (La Biennale d'Arte di Venezia), is one of the largest and most important contemporary visual art exhibitions in the world. So-called because it is held biannually (in odd-numbered years), it is the original biennale on which others in the world have been modeled. The exhibition space spans over 7.000 square metres, and artists from over 75 countries are represented in the collective exhibition spaces as well as in the national pavilions.\n\nThe Architecture Biennale (La Biennale d'Architettura di Venezia) is held in even-numbered years.

18;Libreria Acqua Alta;Libreria Acqua Alta is located in a special corner of Venice, far from the most obsessive tourist flows, but at the same time close to one of the most beautiful churches inVenice, the Church of Santa Maria Formosa.\n\nThe peculiarity, however, is not where it is located, but rather how Luigi conceived it.\n\nGiven that when the Acqua alta exceeds 110 cm. on the middle sea enters through the door to the canal and beyond, he has equipped himself with a number of items that can float, a Gondola, a disused boat and even a bathtub, all floating things completely overlaid with books, books of all kinds: books about Venice, obviously because tourists are very attracted to the specificity of the place, adventure books, mystery books, and even in the two courtyards there are old encyclopedias that are now outdated, but which serve as a staircase to see over the boundary wall that throws over the adjacent canal, or climb vertically up the peeling walls.;09:30:00;19:00:00;0;C.

19;Ponte dei Sospiri;The Bridge of Sighs (Italian: Ponte dei Sospiri) is a bridge in Venice, Italy. The enclosed bridge is made of white limestone, has windows with stone bars, passes over the Rio di Palazzo, and connects the New Prison (Prigioni Nuove) to the interrogation rooms in the Doge's Palace. It was designed by Antonio Contino, whose uncle Antonio da Ponte designed the Rialto Bridge, and it was built in 1600.\n\nThe view from the Bridge of Sighs was the last view of Venice that convicts saw before their imprisonment. The bridge's English name was bequeathed by Lord Byron in the 19th century as a translation from the Italian "Ponte dei sospiri", from the suggestion that prisoners would sigh at their final view of beautiful Venice through the window before being taken down to their cells.\n\nThe Bridge of Sighs features heavily in the plot of the 1979 film A Little Romance. One of the characters tells of a tradition that if a couple kiss in a gondola beneath the Bridge of Sighs in Venice at sunset while the church bells toll, they will be in love forever.;00:00:00;00:00:00;0;Ponte dei Sospiri, Piazza San Marco, Venezia, VE;19
20;Mercati di Rialto;The Rialto market was Venice's most important trading center. The name Rialto derives from the Italian rivo alto = the high bank . It was one of the first places in the lagoon to be settled. From the very beginning, trade and traffic have been concentrated at the Rialto.\n\nOriginally the Venice market was held on Saturdays in the large square of Olivolo in Castello. Especially in the early days it was known for having no taxes and other public charges, and in this way it was able to compete with the markets of Pavia and Campalto , then among the most important in Italy. When the government settled here in the 9th century, the Rialto became the driving force behind the development of commerce. The construction of a fish and vegetable market was the visible confirmation of the successful efforts.;00:00:00;00:00:00;0;Sestiere San Polo 122, 30125 Venezia VE;20
